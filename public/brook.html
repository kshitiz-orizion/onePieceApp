He is a skeleton that the Straw Hats found on board of a ghost ship after drifting into the Florian Triangle.[10] He is a Devil Fruit user who ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, and is undead, having been brought back into a pseudo-immortal state because of its powers.[11] He is the ninth member of the Straw Hat crew, and the ninth to join Luffy's crew, as well as being the oldest member on board.[12] He is also one of the two swordsmen onboard their current ship, with the other being Roronoa Zoro. He fills the role of the long-awaited musician that Luffy had wanted for his crew ever since his journey began.[13][14][15][16] He currently has a bounty of Beli83,000,000.[9]</p>
