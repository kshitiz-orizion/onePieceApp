	<p>"God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. When Usopp was first introduced, he was often (comically) labeled as the "Liar" of the Straw Hat Pirates, due to the "Uso" (うそ) in his name meaning "lie" or "falsehood". He was born in Syrup Village, and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. His original bounty of Beli30,000,000 was credited to his alias and alter-ego "Sogeking".[2] During the events in Dressrosa, Usopp awakened his Kenbunshoku Haki,[10] making him the fourth member of the Straw Hat crew to demonstrate and use a form of Haki. His current bounty, Beli200,000,000, is a huge jump from his original, due to his role as "God" for saving all the toy slaves in Doflamingo's underground trades. This takes him from the third lowest bounty of the crew to the third highest, jumping past the previous holder, Nico Robin.[9] </p>
